# EZOffice HRMS Architecture Proposal

> **RFC-001 | 2026-07-10**  
> **Status:** PROPOSAL — for review and approval before implementation  
> **Author:** Lead Software Architect  
> **Context:** Building a complete HR & Payroll platform on top of the existing Attendance module  
> **Source of truth:** `docs/attendance-current-architecture.md` (do not contradict)

## Executive Summary

The current EZOffice attendance system records raw punch events (`attendance_logs`) and computes payroll hours on-the-fly via `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()`. This is correct for a single-use, single-month scenario but introduces three architectural problems:

1. **No immutability**: Raw logs can be edited after payroll is finalized, silently changing financial results.
2. **No audit trail**: If payroll says Ali worked 160 hours, there is no persisted record of *why* — the calculation is re-derived each time from raw logs.
3. **No calendar awareness**: The system has no concept of public holidays, weekly offs, or company holidays. Every day is treated as a working day unless the employee has approved leave.

**This proposal introduces an Attendance Processing Engine** that sits between raw logs and payroll, producing immutable Daily Attendance Records. Payroll will never read `attendance_logs` directly again.

---

## 1. Current Architecture Review

### 1.1 The Problem

```
CURRENT STATE:

attendance_logs (raw punches)
        │
        │  getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()
        │  (re-derived every time)
        ▼
   Payroll Engine

PROBLEMS:
- Raw logs mutable → payroll results unstable
- Calendar-blind → public holidays treated as absent
- No weekly-off awareness → Saturday/Sunday expected to have punches
- Pairing algorithm differs between getMonthlyCalendar and aggregateDailyHours
- No concept of "this attendance data is locked for period X"
```

### 1.2 What's Already Done (and Should Stay)

| Module | Status | Decision |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `attendance_logs` table | Perfect as-is | **NEVER modify** — this is the immutable event source |
| Device sync pipeline (`syncFromDeviceEthernet`) | Battle-tested | **NEVER modify** — the processing engine sits downstream |
| Alternation validation (`assertAlternation`) | Correct | **NEVER modify** — it protects data integrity at the source |
| `shifts` table | Complete | Keep as-is; extend with `break_duration` and `break_start_time` later |
| `leave_records` / `employee_leave_entitlements` | Complete | Keep as-is; extend with `half_day` flag and `paid` flag later |
| `clockIn()` / `clockOut()` | Stable | Keep as-is; the processing engine reads their output, not replaces it |
| IPC + preload pattern | Proven | Follow the same pattern for new modules, don't refactor |
| `employees` table | Stable | Add `calendar_profile_id` (nullable FK); do not touch existing columns |

### 1.3 What Must Change

| Current | Problem | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` reads raw logs directly | Payroll depends on mutable data | Replace with `processAttendancePeriod()` that writes immutable Daily Records |
| No calendar awareness | Every day is a working day | Introduce Company Calendar as the foundational layer |
| Calendar months only | Real payroll cycles don't align with calendar months (26 Jun – 25 Jul) | Introduce Payroll Periods |
| `getMonthlyCalendar()` and `aggregateDailyHours()` use different algorithms | Same data, different results depending on which function you call | Standardize on one processing algorithm in the engine |
| `attendanceExceptions` computed on-demand | Anomaly detection is manual and inconsistent | Absorb into the processing pipeline: validate stage |
| No attendance locking | Logs editable after payroll finalized | Finalization flag + payroll period locking |

---

## 2. Identified Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Why it matters |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| **No Company Calendar** | Critical | Without it, public holidays are "absent" and weekends require punches. Every downstream calculation is wrong by default. |
| **No Weekly Off** | Critical | Employees shouldn't be expected to clock in on weekends. Currently, Saturday/Sunday = absent unless they punch. |
| **No Public Holiday** | High | Holiday pay rates differ from regular pay. Governments mandate specific holiday treatment. |
| **No Company Holiday** | Medium | Company-declared holidays (anniversary, declared rest days). |
| **No Payroll Period** | High | Real payroll cycles are 26th-25th, not 1st-31st. Attendance must be assigned to the correct period. |
| **No Processing Layer** | Critical | Raw logs → payroll directly. No intermediate, immutable, auditable layer. |
| **No Daily Attendance Records** | Critical | Every query re-derives from raw logs. No persisted, stable view of "Ali's attendance on July 5." |
| **No Attendance Finalization** | High | Once admins verify attendance for a period, it should be locked. |
| **No Payroll Locking** | High | Payroll finalized period N shouldn't allow editing attendance in period N. |
| **No Half-Day Leave** | Medium | Can't track half-day leave. Balance decrements by full days only. |
| **No Break Tracking** | Medium | Lunch breaks aren't semantically labeled. Actual hours worked is overcounted. |
| **No Early-Out Detection** | Medium | Only late arrival is tracked. Early departure is invisible. |
| **No Attendance Audit Trail** | Medium | Who edited Ali's log on July 5? No record. |

### 3.2 Processing Engine: Yes or No?

The proposal introduces an explicit processing layer. Let me evaluate both approaches.

#### Option A: No Processing Engine (current approach — on-the-fly computation)

```
attendance_logs → payroll calculation (compute hours each time)
```

**Advantages:**
- No extra storage
- No "stale data" problem (always uses latest logs)
- Simpler codebase (fewer files, fewer tables)

**Disadvantages:**
- Payroll result depends on the *current* state of raw logs, not the state at processing time
- If an admin edits a log from June after July payroll is finalized, re-running the July payroll query produces different numbers — **silent data corruption**
- Every report re-derives the same calculation independently → different reports can show different numbers if logs changed between runs
- No audit trail: "Why was Ali paid these hours?" → you must re-derive from current logs, not the logs as they were
- Performance degrades as punch count grows (every payroll run scans all raw logs)
- Business rule changes affect historical results retroactively (e.g., changing standard_hours from 8 to 7.5 changes all past payroll results)

#### Option B: Processing Engine (proposed)

```
attendance_logs → processing engine → daily_attendance_records → payroll
```

**Advantages:**
- **Immutability**: Daily Records are snapshotted. Payroll always reads the same data regardless of subsequent raw-log edits.
- **Auditability**: The processing run ID links payroll results to a specific processing batch. "Why was Ali paid X?" → open the Daily Record → see the resolved status, hours breakdown, and which processing run created it.
- **Performance**: Payroll reads 30 rows per employee per month (one per day) instead of scanning all punch events.
- **Consistency**: All downstream modules (payroll, reports, payslip, dashboard) read from the same Daily Records table.
- **Reprocessing**: Fix a bug in the processing engine → re-run processing for a period → compare old vs new Daily Records → approve the change before payroll sees it.
- **Business rule versioning**: Processing runs store which version of the engine was used. Historical records reflect the rules at the time of processing.

**Disadvantages:**
- Extra storage (negligible: ~30 rows/employee/month)
- Requires explicit "Process Attendance" step (admin action)
- If raw logs change after processing, admin must reprocess (which is a *feature*, not a bug — it catches the edit)
- More code complexity

**Verdict: Option B (Processing Engine) is the correct architecture for a payroll system.**

The deciding factor is financial integrity. The cost of a silent payroll error (wrong pay) far exceeds the cost of an extra processing step. This is not a subjective design preference — it's a non-negotiable for any system that calculates pay.

## 4. Company Calendar Architecture

### 4.1 Conceptual Model

The calendar is a **layered resolution system**, not a single table. Different layers carry different priority.

```
Layer 4 (highest):  Emergency Closure     ← overrides everything
Layer 3:            Approved Leave        ← employee-specific
Layer 2:            Special Working Day   ← intentional override
Layer 1:            Public Holiday        ← national mandate
Layer 0 (lowest):   Company Calendar Profile ← default working pattern
```

### 4.2 Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Ownership | Example |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Company Calendar Profile** | Defines the default working week (which days are working days vs weekly off) | Company-wide (singleton) | Mon–Fri working, Sat–Sun weekly off |
| **Calendar Event** | A date-specific exception to the default profile | Company-wide | 31 Aug 2026 = Public Holiday (Merdeka) |
| **Recurring Calendar Event** | A rule-based recurring exception | Company-wide | Every 1st May = Public Holiday (Labour Day) |
| **Employee Calendar Profile** | Overrides the company profile for specific employees | Per-employee | Part-time worker: Mon–Wed working, Thu–Sun weekly off |
| **Calendar Event Type** | Classification of what a calendar event *means* | System-defined | See §4.3 |
| **Holiday Resolution** | The final resolved classification for a specific employee×date | Generated by processing engine | 31 Aug 2026, Ali = Public Holiday |

### 4.3 Calendar Event Types

| Type | Priority | Affects Pay? | Affects Attendance? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Working Day** | Default | Regular pay | Expects punches | The baseline; not stored, assumed unless overridden |
| **Weekly Off** | 0 | No pay (or OT if worked) | No punches expected | Defined in Company Calendar Profile |
| **Public Holiday** | 1 | Holiday pay rate | No punches expected unless special working day | Government-declared; stored as Calendar Event |
| **Company Holiday** | 1 | Holiday pay or regular (configurable) | No punches expected | Company-declared; e.g., company anniversary |
| **Special Working Day** | 2 | Regular pay (or replacement holiday) | Expects punches | A holiday/weekly off that the company decides to work on |
| **Half Day** | *Floating* | Pro-rated | Half-day punches expected | Applies alongside the resolved base type (e.g., "Friday Half Day + Working Day") |
| **Emergency Closure** | 4 | Configurable (full pay, partial, none) | No punches possible | Unexpected closure (flood, power outage, pandemic) |
| **Company Event** | *Informational* | Regular pay | Expects punches (unless excused) | Team building, annual dinner — not a day off |

### 4.4 How It Resolves

For a given employee and date, the processing engine asks:

1. Is there an Emergency Closure on this date? → YES → day = emergency_closure. STOP.
2. Does the employee have approved leave on this date? → YES → day = on_leave. STOP.
3. Is there a Special Working Day event on this date? → YES → day = working_day. PROCEED to punch evaluation.
4. Is there a Public Holiday on this date? → YES → day = public_holiday. STOP.
5. Is there a Company Holiday on this date? → YES → day = company_holiday. STOP.
6. Is there a Half Day override on this date? → YES → flag half_day = true. (Don't stop — continue to check base type.)
7. What is the employee's calendar profile for this day of the week? → Weekly Off / Working Day.
8. Is it a Company Event? → YES → day = working_day (event is informational). PROCEED to punch evaluation.

### 4.5 Ownership & Inheritance

```
Company Calendar Profile (singleton)
    │
    │  "Default working pattern for ALL employees"
    │
    ├── Calendar Events (company-wide exceptions)
    │   └── Public Holidays, Company Holidays, Special Working Days, Emergency Closures
    │
    └── Employee Calendar Profile (optional override)
        └── "This specific employee has a different working week"
```

- If no Employee Calendar Profile exists → inherit the Company profile
- Calendar Events apply to ALL employees regardless of their profile
- Employee Calendar Profile only affects the default working pattern, not holidays

### 4.6 Extensibility

The calendar event type enum can grow without breaking existing types. Adding a new type (e.g., "Optional Working Day") requires only:
1. Add the enum value
2. Define its position in the priority chain
3. Define how the processing engine should handle it (expects punches? affects pay?)

This is intentionally simple — the priority is resolved in code, not in the database, because the rules are business logic and must be versioned with the processing engine.

---

## 5. Payroll Period Architecture

### 5.1 Concept

A payroll period is a named date range that groups Daily Attendance Records for payroll calculation.

```
Example periods:
  Period "2026-07" → 2026-06-26 to 2026-07-25
  Period "2026-08" → 2026-07-26 to 2026-08-25

Each Daily Record is "in" the period where record.date falls between period.start_date and period.end_date.
```

### 5.2 Entity

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `name` | Human-readable (e.g., "July 2026 Payroll") |
| `start_date` | First date in the period (inclusive) |
| `end_date` | Last date in the period (inclusive) |
| `status` | `open` → `processing` → `finalized` → `closed` |
| `processed_at` | When the processing engine last ran for this period |
| `finalized_at` | When the period was locked |
| `finalized_by` | Admin who locked it |

### 5.3 Lifecycle

```
OPEN           Admin creates the period, attendance being collected
   │
   ▼
PROCESSING     Admin runs the processing engine; Daily Records generated
   │
   ▼
REVIEW         Admin verifies Daily Records, resolves exceptions
   │
   ▼
FINALIZED      Payroll run completed; Daily Records locked; raw logs still editable
   │           (editing raw logs after finalization triggers a "needs reprocessing" flag)
   ▼
CLOSED         Period archived; all related data immutable; raw logs also locked
```

### 5.4 Immutability Guarantee

- When a period is **FINALIZED**: `daily_attendance_records` within the period date range become immutable (application-enforced: update/delete rejected with "period finalized" error)
- When a period is **CLOSED**: `attendance_logs` within the period date range also become immutable
- Historical payroll results reference the specific `processing_run_id` that produced them — re-running payroll always uses the same Daily Records

### 5.5 Overlapping Periods

Payroll periods do NOT overlap. The system enforces `CHECK(start_date < end_date)` and application-level validation that no two periods share dates. This is necessary because a Daily Record can only belong to one payroll period.

---

## 6. Daily Attendance Record Architecture

### 6.1 Purpose

The Daily Attendance Record is the **single source of truth for "what happened on this date for this employee."** Every downstream module (payroll, reports, dashboard, payslip) reads from this table. No module reads `attendance_logs` directly except the processing engine.

### 6.2 Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose | Why it exists |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| `id` | PK | Unique identifier | Standard |
| `employee_id` | FK → employees | Which employee | Standard |
| `date` | DATE (YYYY-MM-DD) | The calendar date | One row per employee per day |
| `payroll_period_id` | FK → payroll_periods | Which payroll period this day belongs to | Enables period-based filtering for payroll |
| `processing_run_id` | FK → processing_runs | Which processing run created this record | Full audit trail |
| `calendar_type` | ENUM | What kind of day is this? (working_day, weekly_off, public_holiday, company_holiday, half_day, special_working_day, emergency_closure, company_event) | Payroll needs to know WHY a day has a certain status — holiday pay differs from regular pay |
| `leave_type` | ENUM (nullable) | If on leave, what type? (annual, sick, unpaid) | Unpaid leave = 0 pay; annual leave = regular pay |
| `leave_record_id` | FK (nullable) → leave_records | Which approved leave request covers this day | Traceability: this day was "on_leave" because of this specific approved request |
| `leave_is_half_day` | BOOLEAN (default false) | Whether this is a half-day leave (future expansion) | Needed for half-day leave support |
| `shift_id` | FK (nullable) → shifts | Snapshot of assigned shift at processing time | Audit: what shift was the employee supposed to work? |
| `status` | ENUM | Final resolved attendance status | The single answer to "was Ali present on July 5?" |
| `first_in` | TIMESTAMP (nullable) | First IN punch of the day | Quick summary; detail in raw logs |
| `last_out` | TIMESTAMP (nullable) | Last OUT punch of the day | Quick summary |
| `session_count` | INTEGER | Number of IN→OUT pairings for this day | How many times did the employee clock in and out? (0 for leave/holiday/absent) |
| `total_clocked_hours` | REAL | Sum of all paired session hours (before break deduction) | The raw clock time from device/manual punches |
| `break_hours` | REAL | Total deducted break time across all sessions | If shift defines a break, this is subtracted from clocked hours |
| `regular_hours` | REAL | Hours paid at regular rate (≤ standard_hours) | Payroll's baseline |
| `ot_hours` | REAL | Hours paid at OT rate (> standard_hours) | Payroll's OT calculation |
| `net_work_hours` | REAL | regular_hours + ot_hours (what the employee actually worked) | Total paid work time |
| `minutes_late` | INTEGER | How many minutes past shift start the first IN was | For late deduction calculation |
| `minutes_early_out` | INTEGER | How many minutes before shift end the last OUT was | For early-out deduction |
| `is_finalized` | BOOLEAN (default false) | True when the payroll period is finalized | Once true, this row is immutable |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Record creation time | Standard |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last modification | Standard |

### 6.3 Attendance Status Enum

```
present          — employee clocked in and out, on time
late             — first clock-in was after shift start + grace period
excused_late     — admin excused the lateness
early_out        — last clock-out was before shift end
absent           — working day, no leave, no punches
on_leave         — employee has approved leave for this day
holiday          — public holiday or company holiday (not a working day)
weekly_off       — employee's regular weekly off day
emergency_closure — office closed (e.g., flood)
no_show          — employee clocked in but has zero worked hours (went home immediately)
```

### 6.4 What This Table Does NOT Contain

- **Raw punch-level detail**: First IN / Last OUT are summary fields. All punches are in `attendance_logs`.
- **Payroll calculations**: The payroll engine computes EPF, SOCSO, EIS, PCB, and net pay from these fields. Do not store computed statutory amounts here.
- **Employee personal data**: Name, department, salary rate — all joined at query time from `employees` and `salary_structures`.
- **Leave reason text**: The reason is in `leave_records`. Only the `leave_record_id` reference is stored.

### 6.5 Why Each Field Justifies Its Existence

| Field | Justification |
|-------|--------------|
| `calendar_type` | Payroll pays holiday hours at different rates than regular hours. Without this, payroll must re-derive calendar from the calendar tables — defeating the purpose of a processing layer. |
| `leave_type` | Unpaid leave results in $0 pay. Annual leave results in full pay. Payroll must know which. |
| `leave_record_id` | Audit: "Ali's Jan 5 was on_leave because of leave request #42 approved by Admin on Jan 2." This traceability is essential for dispute resolution. |
| `status` | The **single field** that every report queries. "How many absent days this month?" → `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE status = 'absent'`. No complex conditional logic in reports. |
| `session_count` | A day with 4 sessions (IN-OUT-IN-OUT) might indicate a split shift or lunch break. Payroll may apply break deduction differently. |
| `total_clocked_hours` | The raw number before any business rules are applied. Preserved for debugging: "Processing says 8.5h but employee claims 9h." Compare clocked_hours to regular+OT. |
| `break_hours` | Explicitly deducts breaks. Without this, payroll overcounts hours for employees who take long lunches. |
| `regular_hours` | The baseline payroll figure. Every payroll item starts from this number. |
| `ot_hours` | Separated because OT is paid at a multiplier. Payroll reads `regular_hours × regular_rate + ot_hours × ot_rate`. |
| `minutes_late` | Late deduction amount is configurable. Storing the raw minutes allows the payroll engine to apply the deduction rule without re-examining punches. |
| `minutes_early_out` | Same reasoning as minutes_late — stores the fact for payroll consumption. |
| `is_finalized` | Application-level guard. Once `true`, update/delete on this row is rejected unless the payroll period is re-opened. |
| `processing_run_id` | Full traceability. "This Daily Record was generated by processing run #17 on 2026-07-10 at 14:30." If a processing bug is found, you can identify every affected record. |

┌───────────────────┐
│10. Last OUT       │──── YES ──→ STATUS = early_out
│    early?         │              (if already late, STATUS = late_early_out
│  (< shift_end)    │               — primary status = late, early_out is secondary)

        ▼
    STATUS = present
```

### 7.2 Composite Status Rules

When multiple statuses could apply (e.g., employee was late AND left early):

| Primary | Secondary | Final Status |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| late | early_out | `late` (primary, more severe — impacts pay) |
| late | — | `late` |
| — | early_out | `early_out` |
| late | (excused) | `excused_late` |

The `minutes_late` and `minutes_early_out` fields capture both regardless — the `status` field chooses the primary label.

## 8. Holiday Resolution Priority

### 8.1 The Priority Chain (Highest → Lowest)

| Priority | Classifier | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **1 (highest)** | Emergency Closure | Safety concern. Office is physically inaccessible. Overrides ALL other classifications. |
| **2** | Approved Leave | Employee was approved in advance. They should not be penalized (absent/holiday deduction) for an approved absence. |
| **3** | Special Working Day | Management intentionally decided this day is a working day despite being a holiday/weekly off. This is an explicit override. |
| **4** | Public Holiday | National mandate. Government-declared. |
| **5** | Company Holiday | Company-level decision. |
| **6 (floating)** | Half Day | Applies alongside the resolved base type regardless of what it is. |
| **7 (lowest)** | Weekly Off | Recurring pattern. The default when nothing else applies. |
| **— (informational)** | Company Event | Does not affect the day classification. It's a working day with an event overlay. |

### 8.2 Why This Order?

**Leave over Holiday**: An employee who books annual leave on a public holiday shouldn't lose a leave day AND lose the holiday benefit. If someone is on approved leave on Merdeka Day (31 Aug), the day is classified as `on_leave` and the leave balance is decremented. The company still tracks that a holiday occurred, but the employee's personal day classification is leave.

**Special Working Day over Holiday**: If the company decides to operate on a public holiday (common in retail/manufacturing), the day is treated as a working day. Employees are expected to punch. This is an explicit admin decision, not an accident.

**Emergency Closure over Everything**: If the office floods on Merdeka Day, the day is an emergency closure. Leave shouldn't be deducted (the employee was willing to work). Holiday rules are irrelevant (the office is inaccessible).

### 8.3 Interaction with Half Day

Half Day is a **modifier**, not a standalone classification. It floats alongside the resolved base type. For example:

- "Half Day + Working Day" → working_day with half_day = true. Only half the standard hours are expected.
- "Half Day + Weekly Off" → weekly_off with half_day = true. Edge case — typically not configured this way.
- "Half Day + Public Holiday" → public_holiday with half_day = true. Also unlikely, but the system handles it.

```

### 9.2 Stage Details

#### Stage 1: Collect Raw Logs

- Fetch all `attendance_logs` where `timestamp` falls within the target date range (±1 day margin for cross-midnight sessions, same as the M1 fix in the current code)
- Group by employee
- Include the employee's shift snapshot from the punch (`shift_id`) and the employee's current calendar profile

#### Stage 2: Normalize

- Ensure all timestamps are valid ISO 8601 naive local format
- Flag unparseable timestamps as `data_error` exceptions (these are log-level anomalies, not attendance-level — they should be investigated)
- Standardize timezone handling (all timestamps are naive local — no conversion needed)

#### Stage 3: Validate

- Check alternation: do punches strictly alternate? Flag violations.
- Check for duplicate punches: same employee, same timestamp (±60s), same type → flag.
- Check for punches with impossible timestamps (future dates, year 1970) → flag.
- This stage **absorbs** the current `attendanceExceptions.ts` anomaly detection.
- Validation failures become `attendance_exceptions` rows (the existing table is reused).

#### Stage 4: Pair Sessions

- For each employee, pair consecutive IN→OUT punches chronologically
- Handle orphan punches:
  - Orphan IN (no matching OUT): pair with `null` OUT. The session's end time is unknown. Flag as `missing_punch` exception.
  - Orphan OUT (no matching IN): discard. Cannot determine session length.
- A single day can have multiple pairs (lunch breaks, multiple shifts)

#### Stage 5: Calculate Hours

- For each paired session: `session_hours = (OUT.timestamp - IN.timestamp) / 3600000`
- Apply `max_session_hours` cap (D4 from current system): sessions exceeding the cap are flagged and excluded from paid hours
- Apply break deduction per session: if the session spans the employee's shift break time, subtract break duration
- Sum session hours per day → `total_clocked_hours`

#### Stage 6: Resolve Calendar

- For each employee×date:
  - Look up the employee's calendar profile (or fall back to company default)
  - Determine what day of the week it is → working_day or weekly_off
  - Check for calendar events on this date → public_holiday, company_holiday, special_working_day, half_day, emergency_closure, company_event
  - Store the raw classification before priority resolution (for debugging)

#### Stage 7: Resolve Leave

- Check if the employee has approved leave on this date
- If yes: `leave_type` is set, `leave_record_id` is set
- Leave takes priority over holidays (per §8), but NOT over emergency closure

#### Stage 8: Resolve Holiday

- Apply the priority chain from §8
- Determine the final `calendar_type` for this employee×date
- Examples:
  - 31 Aug (Merdeka) + no leave → `public_holiday`
  - 31 Aug (Merdeka) + approved annual leave → `on_leave` (with `calendar_type = public_holiday` preserved for reference)
  - 31 Aug (Merdeka) + Special Working Day override → `working_day`
  - Sunday + no leave → `weekly_off`
  - Sunday + Emergency Closure → `emergency_closure`

#### Stage 9: Resolve Attendance Status

- Apply the decision tree from §7
- Determine `status`, `minutes_late`, `minutes_early_out`
- Key rule: status is only evaluated for `working_day` and `special_working_day` — non-working days don't have lateness/absence concepts

#### Stage 10: Calculate Final Hours

- For `working_day` / `special_working_day` with punches:
  - `regular_hours = min(total_clocked_hours - break_hours, shift.standard_hours)`
  - `ot_hours = max(0, total_clocked_hours - break_hours - shift.standard_hours)`
- For `holiday` (public/company) with punches: (future — holiday pay rates)
  - All worked hours may be classified differently depending on company policy
- For `weekly_off` / `on_leave` / `absent` / `emergency_closure`:
  - `regular_hours = 0`, `ot_hours = 0`
- For `half_day`:
  - `regular_hours = min(..., shift.standard_hours / 2)`
  - `ot_hours` calculated against half-day threshold

#### Stage 11: Generate Daily Record

- Write one row to `daily_attendance_records` per employee×date in the target range
- Every employee gets a row for every date in the range — even `weekly_off` and `holiday` days (they have status but zero hours)
- This ensures the table is complete and queryable (`WHERE date = '2026-07-05'` returns all employees)
- Assign `payroll_period_id` based on which period's date range contains this date
- Link to `processing_run_id`

#### Stage 12: Index for Payroll

- The `daily_attendance_records` table has indexes on `(payroll_period_id, employee_id)` and `(employee_id, date)`
- Payroll queries: `SELECT * FROM daily_attendance_records WHERE payroll_period_id = ? AND employee_id = ?`
- If any `attendance_exceptions` with `status = 'open'` exist in this period → block payroll (same D5 rule, but now at the Daily Record level)

## 10. Payroll Integration

### 10.1 The Contract

```
PAYROLL ENGINE READS ONLY FROM:  daily_attendance_records
PAYROLL ENGINE NEVER READS:      attendance_logs (raw punches)
```

### 10.2 Why This Separation Matters

#### Before (Current)

```
Payroll reads attendance_logs directly
    │
    │  If admin edits a log from June after July payroll is finalized:
    │
    ▼
Re-running July payroll produces different numbers. No error. No warning. No audit trail.
The employee gets paid a different amount with no explanation.
```

#### After (Proposed)

```
Admin edits a log in June:

1. The system checks: "Is June's payroll period finalized?"
   ├── YES → Reject the edit. "Period is finalized. Re-open period to edit."
   └── NO → Allow the edit. Flag the Daily Record as "needs reprocessing."

2. If the Daily Record is flagged:
   - UI shows a warning: "Attendance data for June has changed since last processing."
   - Admin must re-run the processing engine before the next payroll.
   - Re-processing generates new Daily Records. Old ones are versioned (not overwritten).

3. Payroll always reads the latest finalized Daily Record for the period.
   - If the period is not finalized, payroll can't run.
   - If the period is finalized, the Daily Record is immutable.
```

### 10.3 Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | All payroll items (basic pay, OT, deductions, allowances) use the same attendance snapshot |
| **Performance** | Payroll reads 30 rows/employee/month. Previously scanned all punch events (potentially hundreds) |
| **Auditability** | Every payroll run references a specific `processing_run_id`. "Why was Ali paid X?" → open the Daily Record → see every field that contributed |
| **Reproducibility** | Re-running the same payroll period always produces the same result (Daily Records are immutable after finalization) |
| **Maintainability** | Payroll code has no attendance logic. It reads `regular_hours`, `ot_hours`, `minutes_late` — simple arithmetic |
| **Safety** | Payroll bugs can't corrupt attendance data because payroll writes nothing to attendance tables |

### 10.4 Trade-Offs

| Trade-off | Acceptable? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Extra processing step before payroll | Yes — one click per pay period, negligible in practice |
| Extra storage (~30 rows/employee/month) | Yes — for 100 employees: 3,000 rows/month = ~300 KB |
| Processing takes a few seconds | Yes — runs once per pay period, not in real-time |
| If raw logs change, admin must re-process | Yes — this is the safety mechanism; catching edits is the goal |

### 10.5 Payroll-to-Attendance Reference

When a payroll run item says "Regular Hours: 160", the record links to the `processing_run_id`. From there, you can trace:
```
payroll_run_item.regular_hours = 160
    → came from daily_attendance_records WHERE payroll_period_id = X AND employee_id = Y
        → 20 rows × 8h regular_hours each
            → generated by processing_run_id #17
                → which used processing_engine_version "1.2.0"
                    → which consumed attendance_logs #1000–#1450
```

This full chain is auditable without running any query — it's in the foreign key references.

## 11. Module Impact Assessment

### 11.1 Modules That MUST NOT Be Modified

| Module | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `attendance_logs` table | Immutable event source. Any change risks data integrity. |
| `syncFromDeviceEthernet()` | Battle-tested. The processing engine reads its output; does not replace it. |
| `assertAlternation()` | Protects data quality at the source. The processing engine assumes alternation is already validated. |
| `clockIn()` / `clockOut()` | Interface to raw logs. These functions produce the data the processing engine consumes. |
| `employees` table (existing columns) | Backward compatibility. Add new columns; never alter existing ones. |
| `shifts` table (existing columns) | Backward compatibility. Extend with new columns (break_duration), never remove. |

### 11.2 Modules That Can Be EXTENDED

| Module | Extension | Risk |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `employees` table | Add `calendar_profile_id` (nullable FK to employee_calendar_profiles) | Low — backward compatible (null means inherit company default) |
| `shifts` table | Add `break_start_time`, `break_duration` (nullable) | Low — backward compatible (null means no break) |
| `leave_records` table | Add `is_half_day` (boolean, default false), `is_paid` (boolean, default true for annual/sick) | Low — backward compatible (default matches current behavior) |
| `payroll_settings` table | Add `company_calendar_profile` columns (week_start_day, working_days bitmask) | Low — backward compatible (default Mon–Fri) |
| `attendance_exceptions` table | Add `processing_run_id` FK | Low — backward compatible (null for existing rows) |
| IPC attendance handlers | Add new channels for processing engine, calendar, periods | Low — additive, existing channels unchanged |

### 11.3 Modules That Should Be REFACTORED

| Current | Refactored To | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| `attendance.ts` (1396 LOC monolithic) | `attendanceClock.ts`, `attendanceShift.ts`, `attendanceLeave.ts`, `attendanceQuery.ts` | Current file does too many things. Split by domain before adding processing engine. |
| `getMonthlyCalendar()` + `aggregateDailyHours()` (two different algorithms) | `attendanceProcessor.ts` (single unified algorithm) | Two functions produce different results from same data. The processing engine standardizes this. |
| Duplicated date-range expansion (3+ places) | `shared/dateUtils.ts` | Extract before adding more date logic in the processing engine. |
| `computeAttendanceExceptions()` (standalone) | Absorbed into processing pipeline Stage 3 (Validate) | Anomaly detection is part of processing, not a separate concern. |

### 11.4 New Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `company_calendar_profiles` | Defines default working week (singleton) |
| `employee_calendar_profiles` | Per-employee override of working week |
| `calendar_events` | Date-specific exceptions (holidays, special days, closures) |
| `recurring_calendar_events` | Rule-based recurring events (every 1st May) |
| `payroll_periods` | Named date ranges for payroll grouping |
| `daily_attendance_records` | Processed attendance — one row per employee per day |
| `processing_runs` | Audit trail of processing engine executions |
| `attendanceProcessor.ts` | The processing engine service |

### 11.5 Backward Compatibility Strategy

The existing `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` (used by payroll) continues to work during the transition. The new processing engine runs in parallel:

```
Phase N:   getMonthlyAttendanceSummary() reads raw logs (current behavior)
Phase N+1: Processing engine writes Daily Records. Payroll still reads raw logs.
Phase N+2: Payroll switches to read Daily Records. getMonthlyAttendanceSummary() deprecated.
Phase N+3: getMonthlyAttendanceSummary() removed.
```

This ensures no feature is broken during the migration. The old and new systems coexist for at least one phase.

---

## 12. Implementation Roadmap

### 12.1 Why This Order?

The order is driven by dependency hierarchy:

```
Company Calendar (Phase 1)
    ↓ (needed by)
Payroll Period (Phase 2)
    ↓ (needed by)
Processing Engine (Phase 3)
    ↓ (produces)
Daily Records (Phase 4)
    ↓ (consumed by)
Payroll Engine Rewire (Phase 5)
    ↓ (enables)
Finalization & Locking (Phase 6)
    ↓ (enables)
Reports & Payslip (Phase 7)
    ↓ (above must be stable)
Advanced Features (Phase 8)
```

Each phase builds on the previous. Nothing is parallelizable because each layer depends on the one below it.

### 12.2 Phase Details

#### Phase 1: Company Calendar (Foundation)

**Deliverables:**
- `company_calendar_profiles` — defines default working week
- `employee_calendar_profiles` — per-employee override (optional, nullable)
- `calendar_events` — date-specific exceptions (public holidays, company holidays, special working days, emergency closures, company events, half days)
- `recurring_calendar_events` — rule-based recurring events
- Seed data: Malaysian public holidays 2026 (Merdeka, Hari Raya, Deepavali, CNY, Labour Day, etc.)
- UI: Calendar Management page (list events, add/edit/delete, import public holiday CSV)

**Why first:** Every downstream module needs to know "is this a working day?" Without the calendar, the processing engine has nothing to resolve.

**Estimated complexity:** Medium. Schema is straightforward. UI is a standard CRUD table + recurring rule editor.

#### Phase 2: Payroll Periods

**Deliverables:**
- `payroll_periods` table
- UI: Period Management page (create period, set date range, view status)
- Period lifecycle state machine (open → processing → finalized → closed)
- Validation: no overlapping periods
- Auto-assign: each `daily_attendance_record` gets a `payroll_period_id` based on its date

**Why second:** The processing engine needs to know period boundaries. Daily Records are grouped by period. Without periods, we can't lock or finalize anything.

**Estimated complexity:** Low. Simple CRUD + validation. The state machine has clear transitions.

#### Phase 3: Attendance Processing Engine (Core)

**Deliverables:**
- `processing_runs` table — audit trail of processing engine executions
- `attendanceProcessor.ts` — the 12-stage processing pipeline
- IPC handlers: `attendance:processPeriod`, `attendance:getProcessingStatus`, `attendance:listProcessingRuns`
- UI: "Process Attendance" button in a new "Processing" tab or payroll run flow
- Absorb `attendanceExceptions.ts` logic into Stage 3 (Validate)
- Standardize the pairing algorithm (replacing the two divergent ones)

**Why third:** After calendar and periods exist, the processing engine can consume them. This is the most critical phase — get it right.

**Estimated complexity:** High. This is the core architectural change. The logic is non-trivial (12 stages, each with edge cases). Must be thoroughly tested against known datasets.

#### Phase 4: Daily Attendance Records (Storage)

**Deliverables:**
- `daily_attendance_records` table
- Processing engine writes to this table at Stage 11
- IPC handlers: `attendance:getDailyRecords`, `attendance:getEmployeeDailySummary`
- UI: "Daily Records" tab or view showing processed records
- Backfill script: run processing engine on historical data to populate Daily Records

**Why fourth:** The processing engine produces these records. Without the engine, this table is empty.

**Estimated complexity:** Medium. The table design is the main effort. The backfill script must handle edge cases (missing calendar data for historical periods).

#### Phase 5: Payroll Engine Rewire

**Deliverables:**
- `calculatePayrollRun()` reads `daily_attendance_records` instead of `attendance_logs`
- `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` marked deprecated (kept for backward compatibility during transition)
- D5 gate moved to Daily Records level (check open exceptions → block payroll)
- Verify: payroll run results match between old and new approaches (for periods with both)
- Remove direct `attendance_logs` reads from all payroll code

**Why fifth:** Daily Records must exist before payroll can consume them. This phase is the "flip the switch."

**Estimated complexity:** Medium. Mostly changing queries, not logic. The payroll calculation itself doesn't change — only where it gets its hours from.

#### Phase 6: Attendance Finalization & Locking

**Deliverables:**
- Period finalization: admin clicks "Finalize Period" → all Daily Records in the period marked `is_finalized = true`
- Period closing: admin clicks "Close Period" → raw `attendance_logs` in the period become immutable
- Application-layer enforcement: reject updates to finalized/closed data
- "Re-open Period" flow (requires confirmation + audit log entry)
- UI: Period status badges in Period Management page

**Why sixth:** Locking only makes sense after processing and payroll are stable. Locking prematurely is dangerous.

**Estimated complexity:** Low. Application-level guards + UI flows. No complex logic.

#### Phase 7: Reports & Payslip (Output Layer)

**Deliverables:**
- Attendance Summary Report (reads Daily Records, not raw logs)
- Late/Early-Out Report (reads Daily Records)
- Leave Balance Report (reads entitlements — no change)
- Payslip generation (reads Daily Records for attendance section)
- All reports are consistent because they share the same Daily Records source
- Remove the old `getLateReport()` that reads raw logs

**Why seventh:** Reports are the presentation layer. They should be the last thing built on top of stable data.

**Estimated complexity:** Medium. Report design + Excel/PDF generation. The data is already computed; reports are formatting.

#### Phase 8: Advanced Features (Polish)

**Deliverables:**
- Half-day leave support (`leave_records.is_half_day` → processing engine handles half-day logic)
- Break tracking (`shifts.break_start_time` + `break_duration` → processing engine subtracts breaks)
- Early-out detection (processing engine compares last OUT to shift end)
- Auto-checkout for missing OUT punches (configurable: insert shift end time as OUT)
- Employee self-service portal (view own attendance, submit leave)
- Multi-device support (multiple `device_ip` entries)
- Real-time device listener (background polling at configurable interval)

**Why last:** These are features, not architecture. They build on the stable foundation without changing it.

**Estimated complexity:** Varies by feature. Some are simple (break tracking), others are significant (self-service portal).

## 13. Architecture Critique (Self-Review)

### 13.1 Weakness #1: Over-Engineering for SME Scale

**Criticism:** This architecture introduces a processing engine, payroll periods, calendar profiles, and a 12-stage pipeline for what is currently a single-user SME desktop app. Is this necessary?

**Response:** The question is not "how many users?" but "are we calculating people's pay?" A bug in a 2-employee company that results in wrong salary is as serious as in a 200-employee company. The processing engine exists to prevent one class of bugs: payroll reading mutable data. This is not about scale — it's about correctness.

However, there is a valid concern: the initial seed data burden. Malaysian public holidays must be seeded. The admin must configure the working week. Payroll periods must be created. For a 2-person company, this setup effort might feel disproportionate.

**Mitigation:** Seed sensible defaults — Mon–Fri working week, 15 common Malaysian public holidays for 2026-2027, and auto-create the first payroll period based on the current month's date range. The admin can use the system immediately without configuration.

### 13.2 Weakness #2: Two Sources of Truth During Transition

**Criticism:** During Phase 5 (transition), both the old `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` and the new Daily Records produce attendance data. Which one is "correct" if they differ?

**Response:** They WILL differ initially because:
1. The processing engine uses the new calendar → public holidays and weekly offs are correctly identified.
2. The old `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` has no calendar awareness → every day is a working day.

This difference is expected and desirable. The transition should include a comparison report: "Old calculation: 176 hours. New calculation: 160 hours. Difference: 16 hours = 2 weekly off days correctly excluded."

The admin reviews this report and confirms the new figures are correct. After transition, the old function is removed.

### 13.3 Weakness #3: No Versioning of Daily Records

**Criticism:** When the admin re-runs the processing engine, old Daily Records are overwritten. If a payroll run was already done with the old records, the audit trail is broken.

**Response:** This is a valid concern. The proposal should be amended: **Daily Records are versioned, not overwritten.**

```
Updated design:

daily_attendance_records:
    - Add `version` (INTEGER, default 1)
    - Add `is_current` (BOOLEAN, default true)
    - UNIQUE constraint on (employee_id, date, version)

When re-processing:
    1. INSERT new rows with version = N+1, is_current = true
    2. UPDATE old rows: is_current = false (do NOT delete)
    3. Payroll always reads WHERE is_current = true
    4. Audit reports can show version history for any date
```

This preserves the full history of processing runs while keeping the "current" view simple.

### 13.4 Weakness #4: Payroll Period Flexibility Creates Complexity

**Criticism:** Supporting flexible periods (26 Jun – 25 Jul) vs. calendar months (1 Jul – 31 Jul) adds complexity to period assignment, reporting, and year-end reconciliation. Is it worth it?

**Response:** Yes, because Malaysian SME payroll cycles are almost never calendar months. The standard practice is the 25th-26th cut-off. If we force calendar months, every SME admin must mentally translate "July payroll = 26 Jun to 25 Jul" — which defeats the purpose of the software understanding their business.

The complexity is manageable:
- Each Daily Record has ONE `payroll_period_id`.
- A date falls into exactly ONE period (no overlap).
- Year-end reports aggregate by calendar year (using `date`, not `payroll_period_id`).
- Tax year reports use the period's end date to determine which tax year it belongs to.

### 13.5 Alternative Design: Event Sourcing Instead of Daily Records

**Alternative:** Instead of pre-computed Daily Records, use event sourcing — store every punch as an immutable event, and derive attendance status and hours at query time.

```
AttendanceLogCreated(event) → AttendanceProjection(query-time derivation)
```

**Advantages:**
- No processing step needed
- Always consistent with raw logs (no staleness)
- Naturally auditable (every event is permanent)

**Why rejected:**
- Event sourcing adds significant complexity (projections, event stores, replay mechanisms)
- This is a desktop app, not a distributed system. The simpler approach (batch processing into immutable records) achieves the same goals with far less complexity
- Event sourcing requires a materialized view for performance — which is functionally identical to Daily Records, just implemented differently
- The team is not familiar with event sourcing patterns; introducing them now would delay delivery

**Verdict:** Event sourcing is a valid alternative but over-engineered for this use case. The processing engine approach is simpler and achieves the same immutability guarantee.

### 13.6 Alternative Design: Calendar-as-View Instead of Calendar-as-Table

**Alternative:** Instead of storing `calendar_events`, compute the calendar at query time from rules:

```sql
-- Pseudo-view: resolve calendar for any date
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN is_emergency_closure(date) THEN 'emergency_closure'
    WHEN has_approved_leave(employee, date) THEN 'on_leave'
    WHEN is_public_holiday(date) THEN 'public_holiday'
    WHEN is_weekly_off(employee, date) THEN 'weekly_off'
    ELSE 'working_day'
  END
```

**Advantages:**
- No calendar tables to manage
- Always consistent with rules (no stale events)
- Simpler schema

**Why rejected:**
- Public holidays change every year. They cannot be derived from rules alone (e.g., Hari Raya dates depend on moon sighting). They must be stored.
- Company holidays are ad-hoc. No rule generates "Company Director's birthday."
- A stored calendar is queryable, exportable, and auditable. A view is not.
- The processing engine stores the resolved calendar type in `daily_attendance_records` — so the calendar is only queried at processing time, not at payroll time.

**Verdict:** The hybrid approach is correct: store calendar events as source data, resolve them in the processing engine, and store the result in Daily Records.

## 14. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Processing engine produces different results than old `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` | High | Low | Expected difference (calendar awareness). Comparison report during transition validates the delta. |
| Historical backfill of Daily Records fails on edge cases | Medium | Medium | Run backfill on a copy of the database first. Log all failures. Handle each edge case explicitly. |
| Payroll period assignment is wrong (date falls in wrong period) | Low | High | Validate period non-overlap at DB level. Test with boundary dates (25th-26th cut-off). |
| Admin creates overlapping payroll periods | Low | Medium | Application-level validation prevents this. DB UNIQUE constraint on non-overlapping date ranges. |
| Processing performance on 10+ years of historical data | Low | Low | Processing runs per-payroll-period, not on the entire history. Even 5 years = ~1800 rows/employee — trivial for SQLite. |
| Admin edits raw logs after period finalization, doesn't re-process | Medium | Medium | UI shows prominent warning banner: "Attendance data has changed since last processing. Payroll may be inaccurate. [Re-process Now]." |
| Calendar events seeded incorrectly (wrong holiday dates) | Medium | Medium | Provide "Import Public Holidays" feature with verified data source. Admin can edit individual events. |
| Break deduction overcounts (session spans break but employee didn't take it) | Low | Low | Break deduction is a configurable policy. Default = no break deduction. Admin opts in. |

## 15. Migration Strategy

### 15.1 Non-Destructive Migration

Every phase is additive. No existing table loses columns. No existing function is removed until its replacement is stable.

1. **New tables are created** — they coexist with existing tables.
2. **New functions are written** — they coexist with existing functions.
3. **New IPC handlers are registered** — they coexist with existing handlers.
4. **Old functions are deprecated, not deleted** — they continue to work.
5. **After verification, old functions are removed** — only when the new system has been running correctly for at least one full payroll cycle.

### 15.2 Data Migration (Backfill)

After Phase 4 (Daily Records exist), run a backfill to populate historical Daily Records:

1. Create payroll period entries for historical months (auto-generated: 1st–last day of each month)
2. Seed calendar events for known public holidays in historical periods
3. Run the processing engine for each historical period
4. Compare: old `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` vs. new Daily Records
5. Differences are expected (calendar awareness). Document the delta.
6. If any unexplained differences exist → investigate and fix the processing engine

### 15.3 Rollback Plan

If the processing engine produces incorrect results:
1. Switch payroll back to `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` (kept during transition)
2. Fix the processing engine bug
3. Re-run processing
4. Verify
5. Switch payroll back to Daily Records

This requires `getMonthlyAttendanceSummary()` to remain functional during the entire transition period.

## 16. Future Scalability

### 16.1 What This Architecture Enables

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Multi-branch support** | Each branch gets its own `company_calendar_profile` (different weekly off days by state, e.g., Fri–Sat for Kedah) |
| **Employee self-service** | Employees query `daily_attendance_records` (not raw logs) — simpler, faster, safer |
| **Multi-tenant (future SaaS)** | Each tenant gets their own calendar events, payroll periods, and processing runs |
| **Overtime pre-approval** | Add `ot_request` table referenced by processing engine at Stage 10 |
| **Shift swapping** | Processing engine reads `shift_swap` records at Stage 6 instead of the static shift assignment |
| **Real-time attendance dashboard** | Subscribe to `processing_run` completion events → refresh dashboard |
| **Regulatory compliance** | Export `daily_attendance_records` for labor department audits (each row is a clear, auditable record) |
| **Machine learning for anomaly detection** | Feed `daily_attendance_records` + `attendance_exceptions` into a model to detect patterns (e.g., "Ali is always late on Mondays") |

### 16.2 What This Architecture Does NOT Support (Yet)

- Real-time streaming of device punches (still manual pull — Phase 8)
- Biometric template management (ZKTeco device manages templates; app doesn't)
- Geofencing / mobile check-in (desktop app, not a mobile app)
- Multi-country payroll (Malaysia-only; public holidays and statutory rates are Malaysian)
- Integration with external payroll systems (app is self-contained; export to Excel is the integration point)

## 17. Summary of Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Processing Engine: **YES** | Financial integrity requires immutable attendance data between raw logs and payroll |
| Daily Records granularity: **Per employee per day** | Right balance of summary and detail for payroll consumption |
| Calendar: **Event-based exceptions on top of a profile** | Public holidays change yearly and must be stored. Profile handles the recurring weekly pattern. |
| Holiday priority: **Leave > Special Working Day > Public Holiday > Company Holiday > Weekly Off** | Approved leave is an intentional override. Special Working Day is an intentional decision to work. |
| Payroll periods: **Flexible date ranges (26 Jun – 25 Jul)** | Real-world Malaysian payroll cycles. Calendar-month-only would be incorrect. |
| Payroll consumes **only** Daily Records | Immutability, auditability, consistency. Never raw logs again. |
| Daily Records are **versioned** (not overwritten) | Preserves full audit trail across processing re-runs. |
| Old functions **deprecated, not deleted** | Non-destructive migration. Rollback possible at any point. |
| Break deduction: **configurable, default off** | Not all SMEs track breaks. Opt-in avoids incorrect deductions. |
| Half-day leave: **Phase 8** | Not critical for initial payroll. The field exists in the schema from Phase 4 but logic is deferred. |
